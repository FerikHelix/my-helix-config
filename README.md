# My Helix Config

This is my personal Helix configuration that I use every day.
It includes the **Dracula** theme, relative line numbers for easier navigation, an always-visible bufferline, and a custom `esc` behavior to collapse selections while keeping the primary one.

Feel free to use or modify it!
